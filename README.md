## Task Types

- **Everyday:** These tasks are for everyday.

The task list is separated into two screens, **Everyday Tasks** and **Today Tasks**, each showing tasks based on their type.

## Architecture

This app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability:

- **Model**: Custom classes represent the data for users and tasks.
- **View**: The UI, which responds to state changes.
- **ViewModel**: Contains the business logic and manages the app's state using `Provider`.
